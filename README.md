My repository for my CSE 499 Senior Project

currently reviewing academind course
Module- Working with Express.js  using express router

also on #2 Auth of ninja

Week 2
added css link with basic css

added this to inside of create envelope button and it created a cool effect around the page border like if it was in the envelope.  I want to recreate that. it is the envelope without the wrapper div and without the letter div.  I want that look for my details page.
<div class="lid one"></div>
    <div class="lid two"></div>
    <div class="envelope"></div>

I wanted to change the create button into a mini envelope.
